# Tooling
Last modified: June 17, 2024

These are the tools we use for the things we create. We tend to keep up-to-date with the latest stable version of each of the tools listed below.

## General Tooling

### Version Control

We use [git](https://www.git-scm.com/) (via [GitHub](https://github.com/)) for all of our version control needs.

### Project Management

We use [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) for managing all of our projects. This includes issue tracking, bug reporting, managing deadlines, delegating tasks, and so on.

### Productivity & Collaboration

We use [Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com/) for file management, managing external contacts, creating internal documentation, and other internal business-related needs.

We use [Discord](https://discord.com/) for internal day-to-day communication.

## Game Tooling

### Editor

We use the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/) for all of our games.

### Programming Languages

We use **GDScript** and **C#** for our games.

Our first game, [Postbound!](/games/postbound), was programmed entirely in GDScript.

### Art

Game & Concept Art: [Krita](https://krita.org/)

Pixel Art: [Aseprite](https://aseprite.org/)

Vector Graphics: [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)

### Audio

We use [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/) for creating our music and sound effects.

## Website Tooling

### Domain Registrar

We currently use [Cloudflare Registrar](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/) for registering and managing domains.

### Web Hosting

We currently host our website on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). We also use [Cloudflare DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/dns/).

### Programming Languages

For our [Astro](https://astro.build/) website, we utilize a component-based architecture and write our components entirely in HTML, TypeScript, and CSS, with some Markdown-based components for simpler pages.

### Editor

We use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for maintaining and editing our website.

### Blog

We write all of our blog posts directly inside of Visual Studio Code using Markdown.
