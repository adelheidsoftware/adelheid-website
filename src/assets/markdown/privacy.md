### Privacy Policy
**Last modified**: May 12, 2025

<div class="legal-format">

### __Introduction__
We at Adelheid Software Ltd. ("**Adelheid Software**", "**us**", "**our**", and "**we**") respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. While we do not collect very much user data, this policy does set out the narrow types we do collect (through voluntary user submissions or interactions) and how we treat and protect your data.

Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not send your data to us.

This privacy policy will apply whether you are accessing our website, https://adelheid.org, playing our game, [Adelkrieg](https://adelkrieg.com/) (the "**Game**"), or accessing one of our Wiki projects, the [Soulsborne](https://soulsborne.wiki/) and [Dragon Cave wikis](https://dragcave.wiki/) (the "**Wikis**") (the website, Game, and Wikis are together the "**Services**"). This policy may change from time to time (see <a href='#changes-to-our-privacy-policy'>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</a>). Your continued use of these Services after we revise this policy means you accept those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

### __Data Controller__
Adelheid Software Ltd. will be the entity responsible for your data. To ask questions or comment about this privacy policy and our privacy practices, you can contact us at:

Email: [privacy@adelheid.org](mailto:privacy@adelheid.org)

Postal Address: 2716 N Dayton Lakeview Road, New Carlisle, OH 45344, United States

### __Information We Collect and How We Collect It__
The only information we collect automatically is a session cookie when visiting any of the sites for the Wikis or the Game. The cookies for the Wikis are used in order to ensure that users logged into any of our Wiki sites are also logged in across connected wiki sites. The session cookie for the Game is used to ensure you remain logged in for the duration of your session. The session cookie is automatically deleted when your session ends, which will be 30 days by default unless you manually sign out before then but will be automatically renewed if you elect to remain signed in. Otherwise, we do not collect any information automatically through our website, social media, software, or games. That includes usage data, cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, or anything like that. Because we do not collect this information, we also do not use third party integrations used to process it, such as Google Analytics. The only third-party integration on our website is Cloudflare Analytics, which does not rely on any client-side feedback and does not "fingerprint" users in any way, but does collect anonymized traffic information that includes IP addresses and browser user agents in order to protect against denial of service attacks, spam, and bot activity. The only exception to the above rule is that, in the event you elect to contribute any user-generated content, we will collect your IP address in order to enforce any associated policies and moderate the resulting content.

Otherwise, the only information we will receive from you is the information you provide us, either through the email address listed above or through our social media channels. When you interact with us on our social media accounts, such as YouTube, Twitch, Discord, or Bluesky, the information collected is governed by the privacy policies of the relevant social media platform. Users who elect to contribute to the Wikis may also elect to supply us with a name and email address used to attribute authorship to their work on the relevant Wiki. If you elect to do so, you may also provide us with a pronoun preference for use when displaying your edits in relevant locations on the Wikis, such as the edit activity feed.

These interactions will remain on the platform on which they occur. There is one primary exception: Our website offers an opt-in newsletter, where a user may provide us with their email address in order to receive regular updates on Adelheid Software’s activity. We will retain only your email address in that case and will not share it with third parties.

Use of some features of the Services may require you to create an account, which will require you to provide us with a username and password, and may additionally require an email address. The passwords you create will be securely stored using industry-standard "hashing" and "salting" encryption methods. All other information we collect is encrypted in transit using HTTPS (TLS) and encrypted within a database that only we control and have access to using transparent data encryption (TDE).

### __Children Under the Age of 16__
Our services are directed toward adults. We request that no children under age 16 request a newsletter subscription or interact with us on social media without including written parental consent. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at [privacy@adelheid.org](mailto:privacy@adelheid.org). This policy is in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and Article 6(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation ("**GDPR**").

### __Third Party Information Collection__
As mentioned above, we collect and share select anonymized information with third parties in order to moderate our platforms and enforce our site rules. We do not, under any circumstances, sell your data with third parties, and any personally identifying information beyond IP addresses that you provide to us is purely voluntary.

When you interact with us on our social media accounts on YouTube, Twitch, Discord, Bluesky, or others, the information collected is governed by the privacy policies of the relevant social media platform.

You may elect to donate to maintain the Wikis through provided PayPal links. We do not collect or store your PayPal information associated with any donations.

### __Disclosure of Your Information__
To comply with legal requirements, we may disclose personal information that you provide:
* To employees or contractors we use to support our business (who will be bound by confidentiality restrictions).
* To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.
* With your consent.
* To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.
* To enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including any platform’s Terms of Service or similar.
* If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Adelheid Software Ltd., our users, or others.
* To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Adelheid Software Ltd.'s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Adelheid Software about our users is among the assets transferred.

### __Where, How and How Long We Store Your Information__
Adelheid Software Ltd. is based in the United States. As such, the limited information you provide is collected and stored in the U.S. By using the Services, you authorize us to transfer, store and process your information in the United States and any other country where we operate.

All personal data collected via the Services is stored securely in a database using modern encryption methods. The data will be located on a server that only Adelheid Software can access. Where any third parties are or become involved at all in secure data storage and disposal, these third-party vendors and hosting partners will implement industry standard or higher levels of security measures. This information is stored via Google Cloud on a virtual machine located in the central United States. Each of our Services stores information in its own database, separately from each of the other Services.

We keep your information only for the length of time necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which the information was collected. For example, if you subscribe to our newsletter, we will retain your email address only so long as we are still providing you with the newsletter. Individual anonymized data points will be deleted one year from collection. If applicable laws require us to store your information for a longer period of time, then we will keep your information for the period of time required by law. When it is no longer necessary or required for us to retain your data, we will delete it. Where deletion is not possible, such as with accounts created on the Wiki, your information will be anonymized as much as possible.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through our Services. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures.

### __Your Rights and Choices__
We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. If you have signed up for our newsletter or otherwise believe we have retained your personal information, you may contact us with any of the following requests:

* **__The right to access__** - You have the right to request Adelheid Software provide you with copies of your personal data.
* **__The right to rectification__** - You have the right to request that Adelheid Software correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request Adelheid Software complete information you believe is incomplete.
* **__The right to be forgotten__** - You have the right to request that Adelheid Software erase your personal data.
* **__The right to restrict processing__** - You have the right to request that Adelheid Software restrict the processing of your personal data.
* **__The right to object to processing__** - You have the right to object to Adelheid Software's processing of your personal data.
* **__The right to data portability__** - You have the right to request that Adelheid Software transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you.

These requests comply with the requirements of the European General Data Protection Regulation. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at our email: [privacy@adelheid.org](mailto:privacy@adelheid.org).

### __Changes to Our Privacy Policy__
We may update our privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will post the new privacy policy on this page with a notice that the privacy policy has been updated.

The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for periodically visiting this privacy policy to check for any changes.
