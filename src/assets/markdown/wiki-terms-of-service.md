In connection with the Wikis, we have adopted and implemented a policy respecting copyright law that provides for the removal of any infringing materials and for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of users of the Wikis who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights, including copyrights. If you are a copyright owner or an agent of a copyright owner and believe that any content in the Wikis infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("<strong>DMCA</strong>") by contacting our Copyright Agent at dmca-agent@adelheid.org. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice may not be valid.

          <li>An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other right being infringed;</li>
          <li>A description of the copyright-protected work or other intellectual property right that you claim has been infringed;</li>
          <li>A description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it is located in the Wikis; Your address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
          <li>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of those materials is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
          <li>A statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.</li>
        </ol> Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact (falsities) in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney's fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Counter-Notices</strong>. Regarding any content that was removed or disabled, if you believe that your content is not infringing or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the material in your content, you may send a counter-notice to our Copyright Agent. Your counter-notice must include all the following information. <ol type="a">
          <li>The material alleged to be infringing, including its location.</li>
          <li>A statement by you declaring under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the material at issue was either misidentified or mistakenly removed.</li>
          <li>Your name, address, email address, physical address and telephone number.</li>
          <li>One of the following two statements: <ol type="i">
              <li>If you are located within the United States: "I consent to the jurisdiction of the United States federal district court for the judicial district in which my address is located and will accept service of process from the person who provided the notice set forth above or their agent."</li>
              <li>If you are located outside of the United States: "I consent to the jurisdiction of any United States federal district court where Adelheid Software is located and will accept service of process from the person who provided the notice set forth above or their agent."</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
        </ol> If your counter-notice does not meet all of the above requirements, it will not be valid. As with DMCA Notices, making false statements in connection with a counter-notice may result in criminal or civil penalties. When our Copyright Agent receives a counter-notice, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that party that we may, in 10 business days, replace the removed content or stop disabling it. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the provider of the content, the removed content may be replaced or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, in our sole discretion.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Repeat Infringer Policy</strong>. Our intellectual property policy is to: (i) remove or disable access to material that we believe in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property rights owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party by being made available through the Wikis; and (ii) in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the accounts of and block access to the Wikis by any user who repeatedly or egregiously infringes other people's copyrights or other intellectual property rights.
