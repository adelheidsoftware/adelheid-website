### Privacy Policy
Last modified: January 8, 2024

### __Introduction__
We at Adelheid Software Ltd. (“**Adelheid Software**” or “**We**”) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. While we do not collect almost any user data, this policy does set out the narrow types we do collect (through voluntary user submissions) and how we treat and protect your data.

Please read this policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not send your data to us.

By accessing our website, playing our games, utilizing our software, or choosing to interact with us via email or social media (the “**Services**”), you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to Our Privacy Policy). Your continued use of these Services after we revise this policy means you accept those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

### __Data Controller__
Adelheid Software Ltd. will be the entity responsible for your data. To ask questions or comment about this privacy policy and our privacy practices, you can contact us at: 

Email: [privacy@adelheid.org](mailto:privacy@adelheid.org) 

Postal Address: 2716 N Dayton Lakeview Road, New Carlisle, OH 45344, United States 

### __Information We Collect and How We Collect It__
We do not collect any information automatically through our website, social media, software, or games. That includes usage data, cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, or anything like that. Because we do not collect this information, we also do not use third party integrations used to process it, such as Google Analytics. The only third-party integration on our website is Cloudflare Analytics, which does not rely on any client-side feedback and does not “fingerprint” users in any way.

The only information we will receive from you is the information you provide us, either through the email address listed above or through our social media channels. When you interact with us on our social media accounts, such as YouTube, Twitch, Discord, or Bluesky, the information collected is governed by the privacy policies of the relevant social media platform.

These interactions will remain on the platform on which they occur. There is one primary exception: Our website offers an opt-in newsletter, where a user may provide us with their email address in order to receive regular updates on Adelheid Software’s activity. We will retain only your email address in that case and will not share it with third parties. 

### __Children Under the Age of 16__
We request that no children under age 16 request a newsletter subscription or interact with us on social media without including written parental consent. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 16, please contact us at [privacy@adelheid.org](mailto:privacy@adelheid.org). This policy is in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and Article 6(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR**”).

### __Third Party Information Collection__
As mentioned above, we do not share, sell, or otherwise connect your data with third parties. The only time we will receive data with third parties involved is when you interact with us on social media.

When you interact with us on our social media accounts, for example, YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and Bluesky, the information collected is governed by the privacy policies of the relevant social media platform.

### __Disclosure of Your Information__
To comply with legal requirements, we may disclose personal information that you provide:
* To employees or contractors we use to support our business (who will be bound by confidentiality restrictions).
* To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.
* With your consent.
* To comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.
* To enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including any platform’s Term of Service or similar.
* If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Adelheid Software Ltd., our users, or others.
* To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of Adelheid Software Ltd.'s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by Adelheid Software about our users is among the assets transferred.

### __Where, How and How Long We Store Your Information__
Adelheid Software Ltd. is based in the United States. As such, the limited information you provide is collected and stored in the U.S. By using the Services, you authorize us to transfer, store and process your information in the United States and any other country where we operate.

All personal data collected via the Services is stored securely in a database using modern encryption methods. The data will be located on a server that only Adelheid Software can access. Where any third parties are or become involved at all in secure data storage and disposal, these third-party vendors and hosting partners will implement industry standard or higher levels of security measures.

We keep your information only for the length of time necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which the information was collected. For example, if you subscribe to our newsletter, we will retain your email address only so long as we are still providing you with the newsletter. Individual anonymized data points will be deleted one year from collection. If applicable laws require us to store your information for a longer period of time, then we will keep your information for the period of time required by law. When it is no longer necessary or required for us to retain your data, we will delete it.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet and mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted through our Services. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures.

### __Your Rights and Choices__
We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. If you have signed up for our newsletter or otherwise believe we have retained your personal information, you may contact us with any of the following requests: 

* **__The right to access__** - You have the right to request Adelheid Software provide you with copies of your personal data.
* **__The right to rectification__** - You have the right to request that Adelheid Software correct any information you believe is inaccurate. You also have the right to request Adelheid Software complete information you believe is incomplete.
* **__The right to be forgotten__** - You have the right to request that Adelheid Software erase your personal data.
* **__The right to restrict processing__** - You have the right to request that Adelheid Software restrict the processing of your personal data.

These requests comply with the requirements of the European General Data Protection Regulation. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at our email: [privacy@adelheid.org](mailto:privacy@adelheid.org).

### __Changes to Our Privacy Policy__
We may update our privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will post the new privacy policy on this page with a notice that the privacy policy has been updated.
